"GOLLUM","Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in!"
"GOLLUM","'Murderer' they called us. They cursed us and drove us away."
"GOLLUM","Gollum' Gollum' Gollum' and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone."
"GOLLUM","and cool, so nice for feet' and we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet."
"GOLLUM","And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name."
"GOLLUM","Wake up! Wake up! Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once."
"SAM","And I've gone and had too much. It must be getting late."
"SAM","Oh no, I'm not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread."
"SAM","Oh alright, but we don't have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I've rationed it, there should be enough."
"GOLLUM","Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry."
"SAM","There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it."
"SAM","Oh no! What do I do? What do I do?"
"SAM","Get off of me! Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot! Get off of me!"
"SAM","We're going that way, straight as we can. There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need."
"SAM","Mr Frodo, look. There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch."
"SAM","I don't think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo."
"GOLLUM","Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? Caught in a web. Soon you'll be eaten."
"GOLLUM","Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time."
"GOLLUM","It wasn't us. It wasn't us. Smeagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it."
"SAM","What are you up to?   Sneaking off are we?"
"GOLLUM","Sneaking?   Sneaking?   Fat Hobbit is always so polite.   Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak! '  Sneak?   Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice very nice!"
"SAM","Alright!   Alright!   You just startled me is all.   What were you doing?"
"SAM","Fine, have it your own way.     I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on."
"SAM","It's always dark here.     It's gone!   The elven bread!"
"GOLLUM","Smeagol?   No, no, not poor Smeagol.   Smeagol hates nasty elf bread."
"SAM","You're a lying rat!   What did you do with it?"
"GOLLUM","Look, what's this?     Crumbs on his jacketses.   He took it!  , He took it!   I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's not looking."
"SAM","That's a filthy lie!     You stinking, two faced sneak!"
"SAM","Oh my!    I'm sorry.   I didn't mean it to go so far.   I was just so, so angry!   Here just' let's just rest a bit."
"SAM","No.   No you're not all right, you're exhausted.   It's that Gollum.   It's this place.   It's that thing around your neck.   I could help a bit.   I could carry it for a while, carry it for a while   I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share the load"
"SAM","I don't want to keep it.   I just want to help."
"SAM","Shut up you!     Go away!   Get out of here!"
"SAM","But he's a liar!   He's poisoned you against me."
"SAM","I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales."
"SAM","I wonder if people will ever say, ""Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. "" And they'll say, ""Yes! That's one of my favourite stories. "" ""Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? "" ""Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot. "","
"SAM","Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious."
"GOLLUM","Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. We ought to wring his filthy little neck., Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we take the precious......and we be the master!"
"GOLLUM","Careful master!   Careful.    Very far to fall.   Very dangerous are the stairs."
"SAM","Mr Frodo!   Get back you!   Don't touch him."
"GOLLUM","Why does he hates poor Smeagol?   What has Smeagol ever done to him?   Master?   Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden.   Fat one cannot know.  ,   He wants it.   He needs it.   Smeagol sees it in his eye.   Very soon he will ask you for it.   You will see.    The fat one will take it from you!"
"GOLLUM","Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl."
"SAM","Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?"
"GOLLUM","Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead."
"GOLLUM","Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smeagol will show you the way."
"GOLLUM","lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was trying to save you, see?"
"GOLLUM","No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master. Nice Hobbits."
"SAM","Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died?   He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!"
"SAM","It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?"
"SAM","I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.... . because how could the end be happy?   How could the world go back to the way it was......when so much bad had happened?"
"SAM","But in the end, it's only a passing thing......this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now."
"SAM","Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going......because they were holding on to something."
"SAM","That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for."
"GOLLUM","The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet"
"GOLLUM","Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false."
"SAM","We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear."
"SAM","Stop it! Leave him alone. Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!"
"SAM","Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?"
"GOLLUM","We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False."
"GOLLUM","Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!"
"GOLLUM","Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me."
"GOLLUM","We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious. Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free!"
"GOLLUM","They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!"
"SAM","You'll make him sick, you will......behaving like that. There's only one way to eata brace of coneys."
"SAM","Boil them, mash themstick them in a stew. Lovely, big, golden chipswith a nice piece of fried fish."
"GOLLUM","Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish. Give it to us raw......and wriggling. You keep nasty chips."
"SAM","Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in himbut lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about."
"GOLLUM","Wicked Men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armiesto him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready."
"GOLLUM","To make his war. The last war that will coverall the world in Shadow."
"SAM","I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it."
"SAM","Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?"
"SAM","It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North. Something's drawn its gaze."
"SAM","Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He is crying. ) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields, (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him. ) and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?"
"SAM","Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!"
"GOLLUM","Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the precious!"
"SAM","Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now."
"GOLLUM","Master says to show himthe way into Mordor. So good Smeagol doesmaster says so."
"SAM","Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down."
"SAM","I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloakswill hide us in there."
"GOLLUM","No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wantingto go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it."
"SAM","Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have been her. It would've been her."
"SAM","You will not touch him again! Come on then, finish it!"
"GOLLUM","See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit."
"GOLLUM","A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take youon safe paths through the mist. Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be."
"SAM","I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days."
"GOLLUM","No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious!"
"GOLLUM","What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve!"
"GOLLUM","Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go."
"SAM","Bogs and ropeand goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it."
"SAM","Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning. I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something."
"SAM","Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. Wake up. Don't leave me here alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead."
"SAM","I thought I'd lost you. So I took it, only for safekeeping."
"SAM","Come on Mr Frodo. We'd best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin."
"SAM","We did it Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor."
"SAM","We have to go in there Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on let's just make it down the hill for starters."
"GOLLUM","All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights."
"GOLLUM","Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own."
"GOLLUM","Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength."
"SAM","It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime."
"SAM","Yes you will.   Of course you will.   That's just morbid thinking.   We're going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo.   You'll see."
"SAM","Mr Frodo, look!   The King has got a crown again."
"SAM","It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire."
"SAM","Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry."
"SAM","Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer. And it's the one placewe're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way."
"SAM","Let me see. Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread."
"SAM","I don't usually hold with foreign food.... . but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad."
"GOLLUM","Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home"
"GOLLUM","They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead"
"GOLLUM","Come on, Hobbits!   Mustn't stop now.    This way!"
"SAM","What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?"
"GOLLUM","The thieves...............The thieves. The filthy little thieves. Where is it? ............. Where is it? They stole it from us............. My precious.........Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it!"
"GOLLUM","It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it."
"SAM","Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor'sgoing to hear this racket. Let's just tie him up and leave him."
"GOLLUM","We be nice to themif they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants................ We swears."
"SAM","Mr Frodo ? Frodo! Frodo! I thought I'd lost you"
"GOLLUM","Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the precious."
"GOLLUM","The Dead City!   Very nasty place full of enemies."
"GOLLUM","Come away, come away.   Look we have found it.   The way into Mordor."
"GOLLUM","We swears......to serve the master .......... . of the precious. We will swear on.... . on the preciousGollum. Gollum."
"SAM","He's trying to trick us. If we let him go, he'll throttle usin our sleep."
"GOLLUM","To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes!"
"GOLLUM","No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!"
"SAM","Don't you lose him Samwise Gamgee and I don't mean to."
"GOLLUM","Come away Hobbits.   We climb.   We must climb."
"GOLLUM","Up, up, up the stairs we go.   And then it's into the tunnel."
"SAM","Hey,   what's in this tunnel?     You listen to me!   You listen good and proper.   Anything happens to him, you'll have me to answer to.    One sniff that something's not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over.   No more slinker, no more stinker.     You're gone.   Got it?   I'm watching you."
"GOLLUM","It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious."
"GOLLUM","No. Ashes and dust and thirst there isand pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching."
"SAM","Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises."
"GOLLUM","Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!"
"GOLLUM","What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?"
"GOLLUM","No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead!"
"GOLLUM","And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again! Its ours! Ours!"
"GOLLUM","We must get the precious! We must get it back!"
"GOLLUM","Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!"
"GOLLUM","Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel."
"GOLLUM","And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses."
"GOLLUM","No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes then we will find it."
"GOLLUM","Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!"
"SAM","I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us."
"GOLLUM","Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!"
"SAM","I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to kill us!"
"SAM","That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived!"
"SAM","D'you hear that!   Rivendell! We're going to see the elves!"
