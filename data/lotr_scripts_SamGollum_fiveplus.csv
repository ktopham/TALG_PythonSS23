"GOLLUM","Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in!"
"GOLLUM","Give us that! Deagol my love"
"GOLLUM","Because' it's my birthday and I wants it."
"GOLLUM","'Murderer' they called us. They cursed us and drove us away."
"GOLLUM","Gollum' Gollum' Gollum' and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone."
"GOLLUM","and cool, so nice for feet' and we only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet."
"GOLLUM","And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name."
"GOLLUM","Wake up! Wake up! Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once."
"SAM","Haven't you had any sleep Mr Frodo?"
"SAM","And I've gone and had too much. It must be getting late."
"GOLLUM","Come on! Must go! No time!"
"SAM","Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat."
"GOLLUM","No time to lose silly!"
"SAM","Oh no, I'm not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread."
"SAM","Oh alright, but we don't have that much left. We have to be careful or we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I've rationed it, there should be enough."
"GOLLUM","Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry."
"SAM","Mr Frodo? What is it?"
"SAM","There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it."
"SAM","You don't mean that. You can't leave."
"SAM","Look! The Orcs, they're moving off!"
"SAM","You see Mr Frodo some luck at last!"
"SAM","Stand up Mr Frodo. Stand up!"
"SAM","Oh no! What do I do? What do I do?"
"SAM","Get off of me! Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot! Get off of me!"
"SAM","We're going that way, straight as we can. There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need."
"SAM","Mr Frodo, look. There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch."
"SAM","Take mine. There's a few drops left."
"SAM","I don't think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo."
"GOLLUM","Master must go inside the tunnel."
"GOLLUM","It's the only way. Go in' or go back."
"GOLLUM","Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes."
"GOLLUM","You'll see. Oh yes, you will see."
"GOLLUM","Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? Caught in a web. Soon you'll be eaten."
"GOLLUM","Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time."
"GOLLUM","It wasn't us. It wasn't us. Smeagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it."
"SAM","What are you up to? Sneaking off are we?"
"GOLLUM","Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak! 'Â  Sneak? Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice very nice!"
"SAM","Alright! Alright! You just startled me is all. What were you doing?"
"SAM","Fine, have it your own way. I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be moving on."
"SAM","It's always dark here. It's gone! The elven bread!"
"SAM","He took it. He must have."
"GOLLUM","Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty elf bread."
"SAM","You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?"
"GOLLUM","Look, what's this? Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it! He took it! I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's not looking."
"SAM","That's a filthy lie! You stinking, two faced sneak!"
"SAM","Oh my! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so, so angry! Here just' let's just rest a bit."
"SAM","No. No you're not all right, you're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's this place. It's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while, carry it for a while I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share the load"
"SAM","I don't want to keep it. I just want to help."
"GOLLUM","See? See? He wants it for himself."
"SAM","Shut up you! Go away! Get out of here!"
"SAM","But he's a liar! He's poisoned you against me."
"SAM","I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales."
"SAM","I wonder if people will ever say, 'Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.' And they'll say, 'Yes! That's one of my favourite stories.' 'Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? ' 'Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot.',"
"SAM","Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious."
"SAM","We're not going to wait for you. Come on.,"
"GOLLUM","Master. Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us."
"GOLLUM","Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol."
"GOLLUM","Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. We ought to wring his filthy little neck., Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we take the precious......and we be the master!"
"GOLLUM","Careful master! Careful. Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the stairs."
"SAM","Mr Frodo! Get back you! Don't touch him."
"GOLLUM","Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master? Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. He wants it. He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you!"
"GOLLUM","But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching."
"GOLLUM","Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl."
"GOLLUM","Yes. No! No! It's too risky. It's too risky."
"SAM","Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?"
"GOLLUM","We could let do it."
"GOLLUM","Yes. She could do it."
"GOLLUM","Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead."
"GOLLUM","Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smeagol will show you the way."
"SAM","Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir."
"GOLLUM","lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was trying to save you, see?"
"SAM","So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget."
"GOLLUM","No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master. Nice Hobbits."
"SAM","Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed Gollum."
"SAM","Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right."
"SAM","Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!"
"SAM","It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?"
"SAM","I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.... because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was......when so much bad had happened?"
"SAM","But in the end, it's only a passing thing......this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now."
"SAM","Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going......because they were holding on to something."
"SAM","That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for."
"GOLLUM","The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet"
"GOLLUM","Smeagol. Why does it cry, Smeagol?"
"GOLLUM","Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us."
"GOLLUM","Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false."
"GOLLUM","Master is our friend. Our friend."
"GOLLUM","No. Not its business. Leave us alone!"
"GOLLUM","Filthy little Hobbitses! They stole it from us!"
"SAM","We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear."
"SAM","Stop it! Leave him alone. Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!"
"SAM","Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?"
"SAM","Spies? Now wait just a minute."
"GOLLUM","We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False."
"GOLLUM","Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!"
"GOLLUM","You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you."
"GOLLUM","Not listening. I'm not listening."
"GOLLUM","You're a liar and a thief."
"GOLLUM","I hate you. I hate you."
"GOLLUM","Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me."
"GOLLUM","Master looks after us now. We don't need you."
"GOLLUM","Leave now......and never come back."
"GOLLUM","Leave now and never come back."
"GOLLUM","Leave now and never come back!"
"GOLLUM","We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious. Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free!"
"GOLLUM","Look. Look. See what Smeagol finds?"
"GOLLUM","They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!"
"SAM","You'll make him sick, you will......behaving like that. There's only one way to eata brace of coneys."
"GOLLUM","What's it doing? Stupid, fat Hobbit. It ruins it."
"SAM","What's to ruin? There's hardly any meaton them."
"SAM","What we need is a few good taters."
"GOLLUM","What's taters, precious? What's taters? Eh?"
"SAM","Boil them, mash themstick them in a stew. Lovely, big, golden chipswith a nice piece of fried fish."
"SAM","Even you couldn't say no to that."
"GOLLUM","Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish. Give it to us raw......and wriggling. You keep nasty chips."
"SAM","Hey, stinker, don't go gettingtoo far ahead."
"SAM","Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in himbut lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about."
"GOLLUM","Wicked Men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armiesto him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready."
"GOLLUM","To make his war. The last war that will coverall the world in Shadow."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo. Look. It's an oliphaunt."
"SAM","No one at home will believe this."
"SAM","You can't save him, Mr. Frodo."
"SAM","I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it."
"SAM","Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?"
"SAM","It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North. Something's drawn its gaze."
"SAM","Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. is crying. And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields, opens his eyes and looks at him. and eating the first of the strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?"
"SAM","Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!"
"SAM","Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!"
"GOLLUM","Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the precious!"
"GOLLUM","The Black Gate of Mordor."
"SAM","Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now."
"GOLLUM","Master says to show himthe way into Mordor. So good Smeagol doesmaster says so."
"SAM","That's it, then. We can't get past that."
"SAM","Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down."
"SAM","Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!"
"SAM","What are you waiting for? Just let it go!"
"GOLLUM","Yeees! Yeees! Precious! My Precious!"
"SAM","I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloakswill hide us in there."
"GOLLUM","No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wantingto go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it."
"GOLLUM","No! There's another way. More secret. A dark way."
"SAM","Why haven't you spoken of this before?"
"GOLLUM","Because master did not ask."
"GOLLUM","Yes. There's a path......and some stairs. And then......a tunnel."
"SAM","No! Don't you let go! Don't let go! Reeeaaach!"
"SAM","Yes Mr Frodo. It's over now."
"SAM","Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would have been her. It would've been her."
"SAM","Let him go, you filth! Let him go!"
"SAM","You will not touch him again! Come on then, finish it!"
"SAM","And that's for my old gaffer!"
"SAM","Not if I stick you first!"
"SAM","Let's get you out of here."
"GOLLUM","See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit."
"SAM","It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp."
"GOLLUM","A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take youon safe paths through the mist. Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be."
"SAM","I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days."
"GOLLUM","No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious!"
"GOLLUM","What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve!"
"SAM","Well, starve, then. And good riddance!"
"GOLLUM","Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go."
"SAM","What is it, Mr. Frodo?"
"SAM","Can you see the bottom?"
"SAM","Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!"
"SAM","Bogs and ropeand goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it."
"SAM","Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning. I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something."
"SAM","Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. Wake up. Don't leave me here alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead."
"SAM","Begging your pardon but they haven't."
"SAM","I thought I'd lost you. So I took it, only for safekeeping."
"SAM","Come on Mr Frodo. We'd best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin."
"SAM","We did it Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor."
"SAM","We have to go in there Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on let's just make it down the hill for starters."
"SAM","There are dead things! Dead faces in the water."
"GOLLUM","All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights."
"GOLLUM","Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo! Are you all right?"
"GOLLUM","his own palm) Our precious."
"GOLLUM","Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength."
"GOLLUM","Mustn't ask us. Not its business. Gollum. Gollum."
"SAM","It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places where there is still teatime."
"GOLLUM","We're not in decent places."
"SAM","Mr Frodo? What is it?"
"SAM","Yes you will. Of course you will. That's just morbid thinking. We're going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo. You'll see."
"SAM","Mr Frodo, look! The King has got a crown again."
"SAM","It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire."
"SAM","Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry."
"SAM","Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer. And it's the one placewe're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?"
"SAM","Let me see. Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread."
"SAM","I don't usually hold with foreign food.... but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad."
"GOLLUM","Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home"
"GOLLUM","They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead"
"GOLLUM","What did you call me?"
"GOLLUM","My name. My name. Smeagol."
"SAM","Come on, Frodo. Come on!"
"GOLLUM","Quick! They will see us! They will see us!"
"SAM","I thought they were dead."
"GOLLUM","Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way!"
"SAM","Saved some for you Mr Frodo"
"SAM","Look Frodo. It's Mr Bilbo's trolls"
"SAM","What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?"
"GOLLUM","The thieves...............The thieves. The filthy little thieves. Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us............. My precious.........Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it!"
"GOLLUM","It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it."
"SAM","Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor'sgoing to hear this racket. Let's just tie him up and leave him."
"GOLLUM","No! That would kill us! Kill us!"
"SAM","It's no more than you deserve!"
"GOLLUM","We be nice to themif they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants................ We swears."
"SAM","Mr Frodo Frodo! Frodo! I thought I'd lost you"
"SAM","It's just something Gandalf said."
"GOLLUM","Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No."
"GOLLUM","Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the precious."
"SAM","Mr. Frodo! It's all right. I'm here."
"GOLLUM","Hurry, Hobbits. The Black Gate is very close."
"GOLLUM","The Dead City! Very nasty place full of enemies."
"GOLLUM","Quick, quick! They will see, they will see!"
"GOLLUM","Come away, come away. Look we have found it. The way into Mordor."
"SAM","It's six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!"
"SAM","Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed!"
"GOLLUM","We swears......to serve the master of the precious. We will swear on.... on the precious Gollum. Gollum."
"GOLLUM","Yes......on the precious.... On the precious."
"SAM","Get down! I said, down!"
"SAM","He's trying to trick us. If we let him go, he'll throttle usin our sleep."
"GOLLUM","To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes!"
"GOLLUM","No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!"
"GOLLUM","But we swore to serve the masterof the precious."
"SAM","Don't you lose him Samwise Gamgee and I don't mean to."
"SAM","Get off him! Frodo, are you alright?"
"SAM","You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!"
"GOLLUM","Come away Hobbits. We climb. We must climb."
"GOLLUM","Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it's into the tunnel."
"SAM","Hey, what's in this tunnel? You listen to me! You listen good and proper. Anything happens to him, you'll have me to answer to. One sniff that something's not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over. No more slinker, no more stinker. You're gone. Got it? I'm watching you."
"SAM","Nothing. Just clearing something up."
"GOLLUM","It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious."
"GOLLUM","No. Ashes and dust and thirst there isand pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching."
"SAM","Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises."
"GOLLUM","This way, Hobbits. Follow me!"
"SAM","Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!"
"SAM","Oi Mind who you're sweet talking!"
"SAM","Ah, I think I'll just have another ale."
"GOLLUM","Lost! My Precious is lost."
"GOLLUM","Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!"
"GOLLUM","Sshh, quiet, mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now."
"GOLLUM","But they knows, they knows, they suspects us!"
"GOLLUM","What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve?"
"GOLLUM","No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead!"
"GOLLUM","And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again! Its ours! Ours!"
"GOLLUM","We must get the precious! We must get it back!"
"GOLLUM","Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her!"
"GOLLUM","We lead them to the winding stair."
"GOLLUM","Yes, the stairs and then?"
"GOLLUM","Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel."
"GOLLUM","And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses."
"GOLLUM","And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious?"
"GOLLUM","No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes then we will find it."
"GOLLUM","And take it for Meee!"
"GOLLUM","Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!"
"SAM","I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us."
"GOLLUM","Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!"
"SAM","You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!"
"SAM","Call me a liar? You're a liar!"
"SAM","I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to kill us!"
"SAM","You don't see it do you? He's a villain."
"SAM","What do we do now "
"SAM","You've had a whole half already!"
"SAM","That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived!"
"SAM","I'm on your side Mr Frodo"
"SAM","There's an eye-opener and no mistake"
"SAM","Let him go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!"
"SAM","But where is he leading us "
"SAM","D'you hear that! Rivendell! We're going to see the elves!"
